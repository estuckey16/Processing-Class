Project: Kaleidoscope

On my honor, I have neither given nor received any aid on this assignment.

For this project, I used different pictures and reflected one sector of the picture. To get the original
pixel, I used the index + width * y equation and used that logic to find the rest of the sectors. To get 
one half of the quadrant, I set the x value equal to the y value and the x value increased until it 
reaches witdth/2. The pixels are then updated and the picture is rotated by 1 radian each loop.
