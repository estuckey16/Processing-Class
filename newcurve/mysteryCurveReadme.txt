Project: mysteryCurve

On my honor, I have niether given nor received any aid on this assignment.

On this project, I used the method where the distance between two points is kept as
the radius of a circle. The center of the circle follows line 1 and a complex formula is 
used to find the intersection between the circle and the point on the line. A line is drawn 
from the midpoints of the two lines to create the tricuspoid shape.
