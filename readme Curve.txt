Project: Calculus Curve

On my honor, I have neither given nor received any aid on this assignment.

On this project, I used the shape of the epicycloid to create a curve. I also used the geometry of a triangle
to find the vertecies given the center point of the triangle. I "cloned" some of my changing variables so that 
I have the ability to reset the screen given the original values so there are less magic numbers. My sliders control 
the radii of the circles and the starting point of theta. I also have buttons to start the triangles, stop the triangles,
clear the screen, and reset the values. These are all activated by having the mouse in a certain area and performing a 
certain action.
