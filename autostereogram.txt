Project: Autostereogram

On my honor, I have neither given nor received any aid on this assignment.

In this project, framework code from C is translated into Processing
to create an autostereogram. This code distorts the pointers for an
image in the background to create a staticy image that contains the 
original image. The code uses a separation value and makes the pixel
on the left the same as the one on the right, so that they are the 
same color. Eventually, the pixel is set into the new array and put
onto the screen as the puzzle. The Z array is created by scanning
images put up in the setup loop and then running the rest of the 
algorithm.
