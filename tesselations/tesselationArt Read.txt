Project: Tesselation Art

On my honor, I have neither given nor received any aid on this assignment.

In this project, I used squares and rectangles to 
create sheets of tesselations that rotate about a 
center axis of the center of the sheet. Each sheet
rotates at a different rate and some run in opposite
directions. A random color is set for each sheet before
the draw loop is run and the only thing that is changed
in the draw loop is the transparency of the sheet. I also
created a hexagon shape using PShape and geometry to use
as a tesselation sheet. As the sheets stack on top of each other
they rotate around the central point. The 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 keys
speed up the rotation whereas the shift + 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 keys
slow down the rotation. The 0 key resets the rotation and the s 
and d keys start and stop the code.
